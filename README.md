Hello Hope you are well.

Here is some rundown of the app.

You can create tasks and add discription, status and priority.
There are 4 level of prioritys:

1.High
2.Medium
3.Low
4.NULL

Depanding on the priority it'll show different color badge (NULL doesn't have any)

The orderBy is High to NULL. High is in top and null is in bottom.
 
The full layout is made with bootstrap

And as for Reordering tasks with drag and drop I userd [Sortable @ 1.13.0] js plugin from cdnjs.com

And that's about it please pardon me for any mistake I made.
